Eventually this will become a set of teaching materials to get newcomers into Rust.

Currently there is a growing collection of
[Minimal Instructives](https://github.com/broesamle/RustWorkshop/tree/master/minimals) which should be considered **work in progress!**

Eeach of them tries to use only a few lines of code to touch the fundamentals of rust as a programming language.

Looking forward to your critique and reviews!
